== Predeployment steps

Complete the following steps before you deploy the Partner Solution.

=== Sign up for a Salesforce account
If you don't already have a Salesforce account, https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/9787ec94-1ace-44cc-91e5-976ad7ddc0b1/en-US/salesforce/salesforce-signup[sign up for one^].

// Configure Salesforce connection go to:  https://developer.salesforce.com/

//TODO Troy, Why is the above line commented out; will we be adding it?

=== Connect your VPC in the AWS Cloud with your Salesforce-managed VPC

When you connect your VPC in the AWS Cloud with your Salesforce-managed VPC using AWS PrivateLink, data traffic flows between your VPCs automatically. Connect your VPCs as follows.

. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/[Amazon AppFlow console^].

. In the navigation pane, choose *Connections*, and then choose *Salesforce* as your connector.

. Choose *Create connection*. If prompted to log in to Salesforce, do so.

. Choose Salesforce from the dropdown list of connections, and choose *Connect*. If you have used AppFlow previously in your account, *Create new connection* may appear in the *Choose Salesforce connection* dropdown list.

. On the *Connect to Salesforce* screen (shown in <<#ConnectionName>>), choose *Production* for your Salesforce environment, and enter your connection name.

. Log in to Salesforce sight in screen.

. Allow Amazon AppFlow to access your Salesforce account.

When you deploy this Partner Solution, your connection name will be passed to the CloudFormation template, as shown in <<ApplowConnectionCloudformation>>.

//TODO Troy, How does this predeployment process work for people who want to deploy to a new VPC? Or who have a VPC but don't have PrivateLink?

//TODO Troy, Are steps 2-4 correct as edited?

//TODO Troy, What if people want to deploy into a sandbox environment? (The parameter description seems to indicate that we have to be in a production environment. I'm not clear on what the param description implies; let's look at that together.)

//TODO Troy, How do we "allow" Amazon AppFlow to access our Salesforce account?

//TODO Troy, What is the "Salesforce sight in screen"?

//TODO Troy, Can we choose whatever connection name we want? Any constraints, suggestions, things to avoid?

//TODO Troy, Where in these steps do we use PrivateLink?

//TODO Marcia to delete Fig 3 eventually; we'll be changing the param description.
