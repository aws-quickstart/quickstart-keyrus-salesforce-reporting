== Postdeployment steps
=== (Optional) Change the flow trigger

By default, Amazon AppFlow runs the flow on a recurring schedule, refreshing the data once per hour. To change this interval, to run the flow on demand, or to run the flow in response to a SaaS-application event, change the flow trigger as follows.

. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and open the https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/[Amazon AppFlow console^].

. In the navigation pane, choose *Flows*, choose a flow name, and choose *Edit*.

. In the navigation pane, choose *Edit flow configuration*, and choose *Flow trigger*. The *Flow trigger* screen appears, as shown in <<Flowtrigger>>.
