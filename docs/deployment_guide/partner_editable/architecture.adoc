image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/keyrus-salesforce-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture, 90%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.

* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets. *

* In the private subnets, an Amazon RedShift cluster of Dense Compute (DC) nodes, one in each subnet. These nodes handle all the Redshift database work.

* AWS PrivateLink to connect back to your SalesForce instance.

* Amazon AppFlow to create a mapping method to transfer Salesforce data to Amazon Redshift. Mapping will field all destination fields. This solution includes a sample workflow mapping file( *.swl) for objects: account, contact, case, lead, opportunity.

* AWS Lambda
** A function to create all the required database objects and schema with tables in the Redshift cluster.
** A function invokes Amazon AppFlow to run it from Salesforce to Redshift.

* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store the Redshift logs.

* Amazon QuickSight to visualize the data that you have run analytics on.

* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage the required roles for te deployment.

* AWS Secrets Manager to store and manage Redshift credentials.

* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the data within RedShift.
