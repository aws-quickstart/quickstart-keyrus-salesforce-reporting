.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
// * In the public subnets:
* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
// **The Cloudformation template creates the following resources:
* Amazon Redshift clusters
* Redshift Connector profile name  ex. “name”
* Amazon S3
* Security group configuration to allow Amazon AppFlow to connect to Amazon Redshift cluster
* Elastic IP address
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* AWS Secret Manager
* An Amazon AppFlow flow to create Mapping method to  transfer Salesforce data to Amazon Redshift
    - Mapping will field all destination fields
    - We have provided a sample SWL mapping file for objects: account, contact, case, lead, opportunity

* Custom Lambda function resource - create a schema with custom tables inside the Redshift cluster and trigger AppFlow to run it from Salesforce to Redshift.
    - Account object
    - Contact object
    - Lead object
    - Opportunity object
    - Case object




// * In the private subnets:
// ** <item>.
// ** <item>.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
// * <describe any additional components>.


// [.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
