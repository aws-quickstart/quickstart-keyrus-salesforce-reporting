image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/keyrus-salesforce-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture, 90%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*

* In the private subnets, an Amazon Redshift cluster of Dense Compute (DC) nodes, one in each subnet. These nodes handle all the Amazon Redshift database work.

* AWS PrivateLink to connect to your SalesForce instance.

* Amazon AppFlow to create a mapping method to transfer Salesforce data to Amazon Redshift. Mapping creates all destination fields. This solution includes a sample workflow-mapping file (*.swl) for objects: account, contact, case, lead, opportunity.

* AWS Lambda to creates all the required database objects and schema with tables in the Amazon Redshift cluster and to invoke Amazon AppFlow.

* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store the Amazon Redshift logs.

* Amazon QuickSight to visualize the data that you have run analytics on.

* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage the required roles for te deployment.

* AWS Secrets Manager to store and manage Amazon Redshift credentials.

* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the data within Amazon Redshift.
